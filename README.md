The database used here is MongoDB (I'm using Mongo Atlas https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

Put your Mongo Atlas connection string in the `.env` file in the variable: `DB_CONNECT=` and your token secret in the same file and variable: `TOKEN_SECRET=`

How to run the app:

`npm install`

`npm start`

Go to following URL in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`
